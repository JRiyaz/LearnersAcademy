# Database and Structure

In the project root directory I've added a database.png image, in that you will find out the structure of the database.
Also, I've provided LearnersAcademy.sql file which contains the database, table creation and data that required to run
the program as well.

NOTE:

1. I'm using PostgreSQL database and, I've designed the LearnersAcademy.sql file related to PostgreSQL database. Please
   make necessary changes if you are using different database.
2. I've a created config.properties file in (WebContent/WEB-INF/classes/config.properties) directory. It contains the
   database related configuration like driver, url, username and, password, please do make changes in that file as well
   as per user database.
